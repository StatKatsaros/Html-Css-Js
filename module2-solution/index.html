            <p>Boneless chicken breasts continue to balloon in size, from what was a standard 5 to 6 ounces each to nearly 8 ounces. While the meat is lean, that extra weight adds up: A 6-ounce breast has 182 calories and 4 grams of fat; an 8-ounce breast has 243 calories and 5 grams of fat. Trim off extra meat in ½-inch-thick strips, leaving the breast slightly bigger than your palm. Use trimmings in stir-fries, or bake into crispy breaded tenders. Individually portioned breasts tend to be smaller—Perdue Perfect Portions breasts weigh in at about 5 ounces each. Here, find 50 ways to take chicken breasts to the next level.

            <p>Rinse the rice in several changes of cold water, and then add to a medium saucepan with 3 3/4 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, and then cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, without stirring, until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let stand, covered, 15 minutes more. Transfer the rice to a baking sheet. Stir together the vinegar, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle over the rice and fold in with a spatula. Let the rice cool completely (about 10 minutes in the refrigerator or 30 minutes at room temperature).
